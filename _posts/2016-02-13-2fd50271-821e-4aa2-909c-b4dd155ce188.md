"Children dream of secret treasures, lost to time, theirs to discover. Once grown, long forgotten: those gems they once sought to find. Lucky are we who still search in wonder, knowing that these  lost gifts are still ours to uncover. Lucky are we who never stop believing, whose hearts still hold as much power as our minds." - Heather McDonald, February 13th, 2016\.
